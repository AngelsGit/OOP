        // 2. Finally, create another class a specific type of car that inherits from the car class.
        // 3. You should be able to hand steering, changing gears, and moving (speed in other words).
        // 4. You will want to decide where to put the appropriate state and behaviors (fields and methods).
        // 5. As mentioned above, changing gears, increasing/decreasing speed should be included.
